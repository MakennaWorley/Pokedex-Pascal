# Pokedex-Pascal
Project 2 for CMPT341 Programming Languages

A simple pokedex application built entirely with pascal which will read in the csv file containing pokemon data and allow the user to print out the csv, add a pokemon to the pokedex, update an existing pokemon, calculate the average stat for the pokedex, and save the user's changes in a new csv file.
